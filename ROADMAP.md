# Amalgam Blockchain Roadmap

## Introduction

Amalgam is a novel blockchain project aimed at creating a versatile and robust blockchain system that integrates various components of the metaverse, including AI and peer-to-peer interactions. The blockchain will be developed from scratch using the Go programming language and will incorporate advanced consensus algorithms, smart contracts, and cryptographic techniques.

## Roadmap

### 2023 - Development of the Amalgam Blockchain Core Protocol

We will commence the development of the core Amalgam blockchain protocol. This includes creating the foundation for the blockchain, designing the transaction validation process, and implementing the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm.

### 2023 - GPT-4 Integration

In this phase, we will integrate GPT-4 into the Amalgam system. GPT-4 will handle API requests and assist in the consensus process.

### 2023 - Development and Deployment of Smart Contracts and Token Creation Features

We will start developing and implementing smart contract capabilities and token creation features in our blockchain.

### End of 2023 - Creation of a Decentralized Social Network Based on Amalgam

At this point, we will focus on the development of a decentralized social network that operates on our blockchain.

### 2024 - Launch of Amalgam Public Beta and Social Network

We will launch a public beta version of our blockchain and social network for user feedback.

### 2024 - Implementation of Enhancements and Optimizations

Based on user feedback, we will implement improvements and optimizations in our blockchain and social network.

### April 2024 - Official Launch of Amalgam Blockchain and Decentralized Social Network

We will officially launch our blockchain and decentralized social network.

### Mid-2024 - Development and Implementation of Additional Features and Services

We will focus on the development and implementation of additional features and services to enhance the user experience.

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a high-level overview of the planned stages of the Amalgam project. As we progress, we will provide detailed updates and additional roadmaps to further outline our plans and goals.
